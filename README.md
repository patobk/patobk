- 👋 Hi, everybody! I’m @patobk,
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Excel, Tableau, SQL, Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to assist and boost a project where I can achieve experience and skills in this field. Bar Graphs, Tables, Pie Charts or Line Grpaphs have been my atmosphere for 6 months. I strongly believe that working with a team, being part of a giant community is so significant-
